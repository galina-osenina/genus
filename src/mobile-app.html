        <p>Our work ensures that mobile apps we design are:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Unique — customized for your individual requirements and objectives;</li>
          <li>Balanced — give equal importance to usability and aesthetics;</li>
          <li>Platform specific — comply with the native design patterns of iOS and Android platforms;</li>
          <li>Optimized for every device you need — look equally impressive on every device, adjusting for different screen sizes and aspect ratios.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You need an app that stands out and gets noticed. There are millions on the market, on both major platforms and hundreds of thousands on the others. App users only give away space to a limited number of apps, and any that don't meet their needs are soon deleted.</p>
        <p>Make sure you've got an app with staying power, that keeps engaging users. Work with ITgenus to design a mobile app that achieves your goals and keeps users coming back for more.</p>
        <p class="emphasis">If you are looking to outsource to a professional custom mobile application design team, look no further. Talk to us about your app today.</p>
