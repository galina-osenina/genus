      <h2 class="h2">Why businesses need QA and testing services</h2>
      <p>QA and testing activities play a crucial role in producing cutting-edge applications. Not only do they help to detect bugs, but testing enhances functionality, performance, safety, the user-experience, and product quality. When testing is properly integrated in the software development life cycle:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Developers can focus on writing code rather than on detecting errors, which speeds up the development process;</li>
        <li>Critical technical defects are identified at an early-stage when it's easier and cheaper to fix them;</li>
        <li>Every module, feature and flow is verified for compliance with project requirements and coding standards;</li>
        <li>Catching issues before the product is released to the end-users helps build brand confidence and credibility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Having in-house testers is difficult and costly. A strong QA team should be equipped with various testing tools and devices, should be versed in the best QA practices, and aware of important new trends in testing. That's why outsourcing quality assurance to independent software testing services providers is more cost and time effective.</p>
